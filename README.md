# genesis
Genesis is a collection of bash scripts used to configure a fresh install of an OS.
When executed, the OS (and distribution in the case of Linux) will be detected, and
the correct setup script will be executed.

## Usage
Just execute `genesis.sh` as root.

## Systems Supported
Currently only Fedora support is implemented, as this is my primary OS.
